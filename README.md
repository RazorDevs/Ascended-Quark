## ✔️What is this about?✔️



Ascended Quark is a mod addon that adds compatibility between Quark by Vazkii and the Aether Mod by the Aether Team.



Many of the features include Skyroot variants of blocks, Ambrosium Lamps, Holystone Furnaces and much more.



The mod will be updated adding other features and most importantly we hope to make some original additions that might keep the feel of what Quark already does in Vanilla.



## ❗Requirements❗



You'll need of course:
- Forge
- The Aether
- Quark
